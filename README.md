# AndroidTry

This is my first ever android application. I tried to explore this field of software development and found that I like it quite a bit.
Although this is a very basic level android application but this is my first ever android application and my sentiments are attached to it.
This minor application will always inspire me showing me the time when i started and where I am now at this position.
This android development gave me the opportunity to explore the world of development. 
It helped me to understande, how to develop a particular idea with what we needed.
